# Project Title: PhishBuster - PhishBuster: An AI-Powered URL Analysis and Threat Quantification System

## 📄 **Abstract**

As phishing attacks become increasingly sophisticated, traditional blacklist-based detection methods often fail to identify **“zero-day” malicious links**. **PhishBuster** is a **GUI-based security application** designed to bridge this gap by utilizing **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **heuristic analysis** to evaluate the legitimacy of URLs and email links **in real time**.
